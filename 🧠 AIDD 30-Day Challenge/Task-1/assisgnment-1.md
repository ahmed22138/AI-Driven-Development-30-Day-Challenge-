# 🧠 AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 1

## Reflection Answers

### Q1: What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?
For me, AI-Driven Development means that developers focus more on thinking, planning, and evaluating rather than just writing code. Earlier, developers write every line themselves, but now AI generates code, and developers guide and improve it.
AI-Driven Development is an approach where human creativity + AI speed together make software development 5–10x faster. We are no longer just coders; we have become AI orchestrators — directing AI, setting goals, and ensuring the final output is correct.

### Q2: How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?
I believe that in the future, human–AI collaboration will become a normal workflow. Developers will use AI not just as a tool but as a team member. AI will handle repetitive tasks (coding, debugging, testing), while humans will make intelligent decisions — about architecture, design, logic, and strategy.
AI will not replace developers; instead, it will make them super developers.
